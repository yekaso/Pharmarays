INFO  - 2013-08-06 13:40:02 -->  column name is 2 column Data is Prostaglandins are produced by the body in response to injury and certain diseases. One of their actions is to sensitise nerve endings, so that when the injury is stimulated it causes pain (presumably to prevent us from causing further harm to the area). As paracetamol reduces the production of these nerve sensitising prostaglandins it is thought it may increase our pain threshold, so that although the injury remains, we can feel it less Read more: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/aches-and-pains/medicines/panadol.html#ixzz2Wm0q8vyz Follow us: @NetDoctor on Twitter | NetDoctorUK on Facebook  kayode Adeoti

INFO  - 2013-08-06 13:40:02 -->  column name is 5 column Data is In 1955, Panadol was introduced to hospitals in the United Kingdom.[1] It was first marketed by Phillips, Scott & Turner, which was acquired by Frederick Stearns & Co, a subsidiary of Sterling Drug Inc.[2] It was advertised as being "gentle on the stomach", since other analgesic agents at the time contained aspirin, a known stomach irritant. Panadol was originally available only by prescription in the UK, but is now available over the counter. In 1988 Sterling Winthrop was acquired by Eastman Kodak which sold the over the counter drug rights to SmithKline Beecham in 1994 Nwabueze Obioma
